# My Portfolio of Data Science and Machine Learning Projects Completed Using Python
Below is the list and summary of all the data science projects I have completed using the python programming language. Each of the project is linked to its own respository for further details and to deep dive into the content and the codes.

- [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/tosmartak/Data-Science-with-Python-Projects/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction%20-%20Classification/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb): Built an end-to-end classification machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes. Experimentation still in progress, but currently with a baseline accuracy score of 88.5% and 5 cross validation accuracy score of 84% on the test data. The aim is to get at least 95% accuracy score after several experimentations with different models and hyperparameter tuning.

- [Bulldozer Sale Price Prediction](https://github.com/tosmartak/Data-Science-with-Python-Projects/blob/main/Bulldozer%20Price%20Prediction/end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb): Built an end-to-end regression machine learning model with the aim of predicting the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for. Evaluated with RMSLE (root mean squared log error) of 0.24 and R^2 score of 0.88 on the validation data.

- [Investigating Netflix Movies](https://github.com/tosmartak/Data-Science-with-Python-Projects/blob/main/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies/notebook.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis performed on Netflix data as part of project completed on Datacamp, to showcase the duration of movies over time and the genre of movies mostly affected by reduced duration.

- [The Android App Market on Google Play (Exploratory and Sentiment Analysis)](https://github.com/tosmartak/Data-Science-with-Python-Projects/blob/main/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play%20-%20Exploratory%20and%20Sentiment%20Analysis.py): Exploratory data analysis performed on Android App Market data as part of project completed on Datacamp, to investigate the apps with the highest share of (active) apps in the market, specific category dominating the market, categories with the fewest number of apps and few factors that affect users preference on app to download.
